# Graph Algorithm Library

## Overview
There is a graph algorithm program collection written in C++.  
**It is written for learning, self-righteous comments are conspicuous.**

Update it regularly.


### Description

Write the following algorithms.

* Elementary Graph Algorithms(Breadth-first-search, Depth-first-search, Topological sort, Strongly connected components)
* Minimun Spanning Trees(The algorithms of Kruskal and Prim)
* Single-Source Shortest Path(The Bellman-Ford algorithm、Dijkstra's algorithm)
* All-Pairs Shortest Paths(The Floyd-Warshall algorithm)
* Maxinum Flow(The Ford-Fulkerson method、The Edmonds-Kerp algoerithm)


And open source with a [public repository][mnrn] on GitHub.

### Demo

I checked the algorithm with [AOJ][AOJ].  
The URL of the problem confirmed in submission.cpp in Verify existing in each directory is stuck.

### Reference

Following site as a reference.
- [spaghetti source][spaghetti source]
- [libalgo][libalgo]

Basically, I describe the program according to the contents of [Introduction to Algorithms][CLRS].
